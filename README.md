ONOS-SSM: Scalable Security-Mode Open Network Operating System
====================================

### What is ONOS?
ONOS is a new SDN network operating system designed for high availability,
performance, scale-out.

### Top-Level Features

* High availability through clustering and distributed state management.
* Scalability through clustering and sharding of network device control.
* Performance that is good for a first release, and which has an architecture
  that will continue to support improvements.
* Northbound abstractions for a global network view, network graph, and
  application intents.
* Pluggable southbound for support of OpenFlow and new or legacy protocols.
* Graphical user interface to view multi-layer topologies and inspect elements
  of the topology.
* REST API for access to Northbound abstractions as well as CLI commands.
* CLI for debugging.
* Support for both proactive and reactive flow setup.
* SDN-IP application to support interworking with traditional IP networks
  controlled by distributed routing protocols such as BGP.
* IP-Optical use case demonstration.

### What is ONOS-SSM?
ONOS-SSM is a new SDN network operating system designed for high availability, performance, scale-out and security.
ONOS-SSM is under developing to support BUCK, new build system.
